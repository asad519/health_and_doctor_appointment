# Medic.ly - Health & Doctor Appointment App

Hi! I’m a full-stack developer, and this is a personal project I designed and built from scratch — **Medic.ly**, a sleek UI prototype for a modern Doctor Appointment Booking App.

The app uses **Firebase** for authentication and data storage, and is crafted with attention to detail in **Flutter**.

### 🔍 Overview

This project showcases how a health-tech application can streamline the appointment process between doctors and patients. From browsing doctors to viewing appointment history, every screen is designed with simplicity and usability in mind.
